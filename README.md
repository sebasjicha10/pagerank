A website is more important if it is linked to by other important websites, and links from less important websites have their links weighted less. 

## Random Surfer Model
Considers the behavior of a hypothetical surfer on the internet who clicks on links at random. The random surfer model imagines a surfer who starts with a web page at random, and then randomly chooses links to follow. 

A page’s PageRank, then, can be described as the probability that a random surfer is on that page at any given time. After all, if there are more links to a particular page, then it’s more likely that a random surfer will end up on that page. Moreover, a link from a more important site is more likely to be clicked on than a link from a less important site that fewer pages link to, so this model handles weighting links by their importance as well.

One way to interpret this model is as a Markov Chain, where each page represents a state, and each page has a transition model that chooses among its links at random. At each time step, the state switches to one of the pages linked to by the current state.

By sampling states randomly from the Markov Chain, we can get an estimate for each page’s PageRank. We can start by choosing a page at random, then keep following links at random, keeping track of how many times we’ve visited each page. After we’ve gathered all of our samples (based on a number we choose in advance), the proportion of the time we were on each page might be an estimate for that page’s rank.

## Iterative Algorithm
We can also define a page’s PageRank using a recursive mathematical expression. Let PR(p) be the PageRank of a given page p: the probability that a random surfer ends up on that page. How do we define PR(p)? Well, we know there are two ways that a random surfer could end up on the page:

1. With probability 1 - d, the surfer chose a page at random and ended up on page p.
2. With probability d, the surfer followed a link from a page i to page p.


This gives us the following definition for the PageRank for a page p.

PageRank formula

In this formula, d is the damping factor, N is the total number of pages in the corpus, i ranges over all pages that link to page p, and NumLinks(i) is the number of links present on page i.
